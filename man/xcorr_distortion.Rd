\title{Measure spectrographic cross-correlation as a measure of signal distortion}
\usage{
xcorr_distortion(X = NULL, parallel = 1, pb = TRUE,  method = 1, cor.method = "pearson",
wl = 512, ovlp = 90, wn = 'hanning', output = "est")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{object of class 'selection_table', 'extended_selection_table' created by the function \code{\link[warbleR]{selection_table}} from the warbleR package.}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).
If \code{NULL} (default) then the current working directory is used.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control if progress bar is shown. Default is \code{TRUE}. It can also be
set globally using the 'pb' option (see \code{\link{warbleR_options}}).}

\item{method}{Numeric vector of length 1 to indicate the 'experimental design' for measuring envelope correlation. Two methods are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: compare all signals with their counterpart that was recorded at the closest distance to source (e.g. compare a signal recorded at 5m, 10m and 15m with its counterpart recorded at 1m). This is the default method. 
\item \code{2}: compare all signals with their counterpart recorded at the distance immediately before (e.g. a signal recorded at 10m compared with the same signal recorded at 5m, then signal recorded at 15m compared with same signal recorded at 10m and so on).
}}

\item{cor.method}{Character string indicating the correlation coefficient to be applied ("pearson", "spearman", or "kendall", see \code{\link[stats]{cor}}).}

\item{wl}{A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram, default 
is 512.}

\item{ovlp}{Numeric vector of length 1 specifying \% of overlap between two 
consecutive windows, as in \code{\link[seewave]{spectro}}. Default is 90. High values of ovlp 
slow down the function but produce more accurate results.}

\item{wn}{A character vector of length 1 specifying the window name as in \code{\link[seewave]{ftwindow}}.}

\item{output}{Character vector of length 1 to determine if an extended selection table ('est', default) or a data frame ('data.frame') is returned.}
}
\value{
Data frame or extended selection table (depending on 'output' argument) similar to input data, but also includes a new column (env.correlation)
with the amplitude envelope correlation coefficients.

\description{
\code{xcorr_distortion} Measures spectrographic cross-correlation as a measure of signal distortion in signals referenced in a extended selection table.
}
\details{
The spectrographic cross-correlation is intended to measure the distortion of signals in the frequency domain. The goal of the function is to measure the cross-correlation on signals in which a master playback has been re-recorded at different distances. The 'signal.id' column must be used to indicate the function to only compare signals belonging to the same category (e.g. song-types). The function will then compared each signal type to its reference. Two methods for calculating cross-correlation are provided (see 'method' argument). The function is a wrapper on warbleR's \code{\link[warbleR]{xcorr}} function.
}
\examples{
{
# load example data
data("playback_est")

# remove noise selections
playback_est <- playback_est[playback_est$signal.id != "noise", ]

# method 1
xcorr_distortion(X = playback_est, method = 1)

# method 2
xcorr_distortion(X = playback_est, method = 2)
}
